# gathering-berlin-v01

While we work collectively and push boundaries on individual projects, we acknowledge the fragmented nature of the (European) Open Source Community, which lacks strong personal connections.

This Gathering represents the initial step towards addressing this issue and aims to serve as a platform for unifying minds, emphasizing the power of collaboration and knowledge-sharing, and elevating the collective expertise of the Open Source community.

Irrespective of your specialization, we cordially invite you to join us in connecting and establishing enduring relationships with like-minded individuals who share a common vision.

* Date: 11th of October 2023
* Time: 7 PM CET
* City: Berlin, Germany
* Venue: To be announced

To confirm your attendance, we kindly request you to join this WhatsApp group via the following link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/GPpekmx34CXGbBUBzO4nrb

We look forward to the opportunity of meeting you in person!
